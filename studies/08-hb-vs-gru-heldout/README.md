# Study 08 — HB vs GRU on held-out subjects

Fits the hierarchical Bayesian cognitive baseline (`HB-Hattori2019`) on **study 01's
cohort**, so its held-out likelihood is directly comparable with the GRU numbers already in
`../01-gru-scaling-law/scaling_results.csv`.

Recovery and validation live in `aind-dynamic-foraging-models` (standalone, synthetic data).
This study is the real-data comparison only.

## The stack

Which repo owns which part of the fit, and where the held-out boundary sits, is
documented once for the whole stack rather than per study:
**[docs/diagrams/hb-stack](../../docs/diagrams/)** — open
[the interactive version](https://raw.githack.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-dynamic-foraging-bfm-dispatcher/main/docs/diagrams/hb-stack.html)
to pan, zoom, search and trace a single relationship.

The figures in this folder are this study's own results; the stack diagram is
architecture and is true whether or not this study exists.

## Cohort

`data.subject_ratio` against the ~614 pool, matching study 01's D dial:

| ratio | D | GRU held-out likelihood (seeds 0/1/2) |
|---|---|---|
| 0.049 | ~30 | 0.7248 / 0.7252 / 0.7250 |
| 0.163 | ~100 | 0.7264 / 0.7264 / 0.7260 |

Same snapshot (`20260603`), curricula, `min_sessions=10`, `heldout_every_n=5`,
`mature_only=false`, `ignore_policy=exclude`. The GRU seed spread of ~0.0004 is the natural
yardstick for whether a difference means anything.

## Variants index

| variant | what differs | status |
|---|---|---|
| [`one-stage-ladder`](variants/one-stage-ladder/notes.md) | `subject_ratio` 0.016/0.049/0.163/0.489/1.0 → D≈10/30/100/300/614, one-stage estimator | see notes |
| [`stan-arm`](variants/stan-arm/notes.md) | same model and sampler settings, fit with pystan on HPC CPUs; population-only, no held-out scoring, so not a rung | see notes |

The status and W&B-group columns used to be filled in here as well as in the variant's
notes, and duplication did exactly what the Status section below predicts: this table read
`running (2026-08-29)` against group `hb-one_stage@20260829-181251` long after those jobs
had crashed, while the notes correctly said no rung had run. One home per fact.

**Deviation from study-conventions:** this study logs into study 01's W&B project
`mice_data_scaling` rather than its own. Deliberate — the results must land on study 01's
scaling curve and be read by its `analyze_scaling.py`; a separate project would turn the
comparison into a manual join. Recorded in the variant's notes.

## Running

HB goes through the **same entrypoint as every other model** — there is no HB-specific
script, and therefore nothing HB-specific to keep in sync:

    python -m run_hpc data=mice_snapshot_scaling model=hb_hattori data.subject_ratio=0.049

`run_hpc` is shared by HPC/SLURM and Beaker, so the same command works on both backends.
Data selection comes from `../aind-dynamic-foraging-bfm-dispatcher/code/config/data/mice_snapshot_scaling.yaml` — the file study 01
uses — rather than being restated, so the two cannot drift apart.

The ladder rungs, on SLURM:

    sbatch variants/one-stage-ladder/production.sbatch 0.016 d10  "$LAUNCH_ID"
    sbatch variants/one-stage-ladder/production.sbatch 0.049 d30  "$LAUNCH_ID"
    sbatch variants/one-stage-ladder/production.sbatch 0.163 d100 "$LAUNCH_ID"

or on Beaker, which is the route every rung run so far has actually used:

    python ../aind-dynamic-foraging-bfm-dispatcher/code/launch_beaker_resumable.py \
      --sweep      studies/08-hb-vs-gru-heldout/variants/one-stage-ladder/sweep_beaker.yaml \
      --experiment studies/08-hb-vs-gru-heldout/variants/one-stage-ladder/experiment_beaker.yaml \
      --workspace  ai1/aind-dynamic-foraging-foundation-model \
      --label d30 --note "..."

Swap in `sweep_beaker_smoke.yaml` for a minimal-sampler path check; it logs to project
`test` rather than `mice_data_scaling`, so a smoke can never land on study 01's curve.
`production.sbatch` still carries pre-rename paths (`aind-disrnn-wrapper`, `DISRNN_META_*`,
`disrnn-hb-gpu`), so prefer the Beaker route until that is repointed.

Two things about the Beaker task are deliberate and easy to undo by accident. It runs
`{priority: normal, preemptible: false}` rather than the launcher's low/preemptible burst
default, because `hb_hattori.yaml` has no `training` block and therefore no checkpoint for
`autoResume` to resume from — a preemption restarts the NUTS fit at zero. And the cluster
must be S3-reachable, since `mice_snapshot_scaling` reads the AWS parquet cache; the GCP
pools cannot serve it however many GPUs they show free. Note also that HB is latency-bound
on scan depth, so a newer GPU is *slower* — pick on queue depth and S3 reach, not on GPU
generation (`hierarchical_bayes/benchmarks/RESULTS.md`).

Both estimators exist; `estimator=one_stage` is the default and the reference. Two-stage
matches it to within 0.00027 on held-out likelihood while costing ~5x the compute, so it is
a fallback for scales where the joint fit will not converge. Override with
`model.estimator=two_stage`.

## Status

**Study level, 2026-10-23: all compute is done, the code and reports are merged, and the
study is closing; nothing is running or planned.** The result is negative: no HB rung passes
the convergence gates, and the D≈99, 300 and 614 chains did not mix, so the HB ladder does
not yield a usable scaling curve with this sampler. The Stan arm measured the D≈29 cost
(#129, closed); no Stan D≈99 fit completed. Numbers are in the reports
([`analysis/reports/`](analysis/reports/INDEX.md), r4 for convergence and sampler cost), not
here.

Merged: models [#77](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-dynamic-foraging-models/pull/77),
wrapper [#100](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-dynamic-foraging-bfm-wrapper/pull/100),
dispatcher #170 (Stan arm) and #168 (reports r1–r4).

Every launch with a finished run has a `results.md` beside its launch record, and the verdict is
recorded on [#72](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-dynamic-foraging-bfm-dispatcher/issues/72#issuecomment-6378130737).
Wrap-up checks, 2026-10-23: `validate_provenance.py --strict` is clean for all 19 launch groups
of both variants, and `make all` regenerates every report byte-identically (see CHANGELOG).

Per-variant state, in the variant's own notes — this README would only rot as a second copy:

| variant | status |

| [`one-stage-ladder`](variants/one-stage-ladder/notes.md) | see notes |
| [`stan-arm`](variants/stan-arm/notes.md) | see notes |
